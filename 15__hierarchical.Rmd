# (PART) IV Hierarchical Bayesian models {-}

**Welcome to Unit 4 - The final *unit* !**

Hierarchical models expand our toolbox for hierarchical (grouped / pooled) data:

 - a sampled group of schools and data $y$ on multiple individual students within each school
 
 - a sampled group of labs and data $y$ from multiple individual experiments within each lab

 - a sampled group of people on whom we make multiple individual observations of information $y$ over time.
 
Unit four will explore these techniques in these final chapters:

- Chapter 15: Introduce the concepts

- Chapter 16: Hierarchical models without predictors

- Chapter 17: Normal Hierarchical Models with predictors

- Chapter 18: Non-Normal Hierarchical Regression

- Chapter 19: More Layers!
